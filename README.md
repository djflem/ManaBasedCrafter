A tool to help create manabases for MtG decks, EDH specifically. After inviting the bot to your server, the user can use slash commands to search for cards or upload decks as a csv file (wip). You may then access a number of stastical charts to assist with deck building and land base refining. 

I intend to implement stats such as: probability of drawing a land, % of land to all cards, how many basic lands suggested for each color, and more...

Currently the cards are searched using Scryfall web API. The bot also uses Discord4j and Spring Boot dependencies for the command language and internal server (not yet hosted and requires your IDE to run). The bot will be deployed after completion.
